# diff-ci — run only the CI gates the current diff can affect (#518, 2026-08-31): the local
# pre-flight for agents and the seat. Same devbox tasks CI runs, scoped by a path→task map.
#
# ONE HOME: this map is the canonical statement of "which paths feed which gate".
# `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`'s changed-paths step eval-extracts PROM_PATHS/CLAUSE_PATHS from
# THIS file (the scripts/pin-only-lint.sh one-home pattern; the #518 flip landed 2026-08-31) —
# edit trigger sets here, never inline there. CI stays AUTHORITATIVE: a too-narrow mapping here
# costs a surprise red in CI,
# never a merged defect (CI's skip map only covers the two heavy suites; everything else
# always runs there). The PR-context gates (pin-only-lint, governance-lint, the ADR-103
# ratchet) need the PR's base/author and do not run here.
#
# Usage: devbox run diff-ci [base-ref]
#   Compares merge-base(base-ref, HEAD)..worktree (staged + unstaged + untracked included);
#   base-ref defaults to origin/master.
