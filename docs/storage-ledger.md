# Storage ledger — who owns the sum of the caps

**Tracked by:** FU-093. **Decision:** ADR-089 (storage tiers with quota-as-contract).
**Style sibling:** [`ip-plan.md`](ip-plan.md) — same idea, different resource.

ADR-089 says every claim states its cap. It does **not** say who owns the **sum**. That gap is this
document: without one authority per tier, two honest accountings can both fit their own budget and
jointly blow the tier — which is exactly what happened.

## The one hard rule

> **A tier's committed capacity is the sum of every cap charged against it, across every repo, and
> exactly one ledger owns that sum.** A claim that doesn't appear in the ledger doesn't exist.

## The double-booking that started this (2026-07-22, closing oracle-iac#40)

Two accountings against the same ~150Gi bulk tier:

| Source | Charged |
|---|---|
| oracle-iac `infra/garage-workspace.yaml` | loki 40 + agent-transcripts 20 + ert-snapshots 90 = **150Gi** |
| oracle-iac#40's own accounting | allure-reports 20 + snapshots + artifact bucket |
| *Neither* | Phase-1 `argo-artifacts` 10Gi, per-repo `argo-artifacts-oracle-fleet` 2Gi (the AgentStack `argo.artifacts` knob, 2026-07-22) |

Live caps to reconcile: `kubectl get workspaces.tf.upbound.io` (8 garage workspaces).

## The other half: nothing meters it

A ledger that isn't measured is a spreadsheet. Four sightings in six days, all the same class —
**a cap breach is invisible until a workload fails**:

1. **2026-07-22** — Garage exports **no** metrics to Prometheus at all (checked: zero `garage_*`
   series). Breaches surface only as faulted writes.
2. **2026-07-25** — Garage LMDB-full at 03:42 surfaced only as a failed sleep-ingester Job (meta
   volume has been 10Gi since).
3. **2026-07-25** — the **Longhorn** side of the bulk tier: 9 retro rides' 20Gi scratch allocations
   pushed both bulk disks past `storageScheduled` cap → new scratch PVCs faulted
   (`ReplicaSchedulingFailure`) → every ride/worker Init wedged. Immediate mitigations: scan
   janitor grace 2h→30min, launcher-side pod self-clean in the retro orchestrator.
4. **2026-07-27** — homelab#56 (responder-filed): `NodeDiskIOSaturation` on wk-02 sdl, `aqu-sz`
   ~15–17 sustained 2h+, no rebuilds or degraded volumes — plain workload IO grinding a near-full
   bulk disk. The alert was, again, the only visibility.

## Build

- **The ledger itself — BUILT 2026-08-02 (FU-093a)**: `devbox run storage-ledger`
  (`scripts/storage-ledger-check.sh`) sums every `max_size` across the LIVE
  `workspaces.tf.upbound.io` set (cluster-sourced — covers all repos' claims with no cross-repo
  checkout) against the garage data PVC capacity. >80% warns, >100% exits 1 (the iac-lane
  "mechanical" predicate refusal). Per-tier, because per-repo accounting is what allowed the
  double-book. **First run found the tier LIVE-OVERCOMMITTED: 181Gi committed / 150Gi capacity
  (121%)** — biggest lines: ert-snapshots 90, loki 40, agent-transcripts 20. Reconciling is an
  operator capacity decision (shrink caps vs grow the PVC); until then the lint holds the line
  against NEW claims.
- **Garage metering** — enable the admin-API metrics (`:3903`) + a ServiceMonitor; per-bucket
  usage-vs-cap panels; a **>80% alert**.
- **Longhorn metering** — per-disk `storageScheduled`-vs-cap. The kubelet metrics already exist
  (`longhorn_disk_*`); add the >80% alert alongside the Garage one.

## Consumer

The ledger is not only bookkeeping — it is the **guardrail that defines "mechanical"** for the
infra-fixer lane: a wrapper change is auto-mergeable only if it is schema-valid *and* within the
tier quota ([`agents/iac-lane.md`](agents/iac-lane.md) §rollout matrix). Until the ledger exists,
that predicate is aspirational.
